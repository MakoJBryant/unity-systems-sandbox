# Unity Systems Sandbox

A Unity project serving as a versatile sandbox for exploring and implementing core game systems, with a strong focus on **procedural planet generation** and advanced **atmosphere and planet surface shaders**. This repository showcases a systematic approach to building scalable and visually rich interactive environments.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Procedural Planet Generation:** Dynamically generates unique planetary terrains and meshes using algorithmic approaches.
* **Advanced Planet Shaders:** Custom shaders (developed with C# and Unity's Shader Graph/URP) for:
    * Realistic planet surface rendering (e.g., terrain blending, normal mapping).
    * Volumetric atmospheric scattering effects for dynamic skies and horizons.
* **Core Game System Implementations:**
    * **Object Pooling System:** Efficiently manages game object instantiation and destruction for performance optimization.
    * **Event-Driven Architecture:** Decoupled communication between game components for modularity and scalability.
    * **Input Management System:** Flexible and extensible system for handling player input.
* **Modular & Reusable Codebase:** Designed with clean architecture principles to facilitate easy expansion and integration into other projects.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Game Engine:** Unity 6000.0.51f1
* **Programming Language:** C#
* **Graphics:** Unity Shader Graph, Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MakoJBryant/unity-systems-sandbox.git](https://github.com/MakoJBryant/unity-systems-sandbox.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Unity:**
    * Launch Unity Hub.
    * Click "Add Project" and navigate to the cloned `unity-systems-sandbox` directory.
    * Select the project folder and open it with the specified Unity version (e.g., Unity 2022.3 LTS).
3.  **Explore Scenes:**
    * Navigate to the `Assets/Scenes` folder in the Project window.
    * Open the main scene (e.g., `PlanetScene.unity` or `Main.unity`) to view the procedural generation and shader effects.
    * Explore other scenes or prefabs to see specific system implementations.
